#Summary

I have used the data from Prosper Loans to show which factors can relate to whether a loan will be paid completely, chargedoff, defaulted or past due. 

#Design
For my first graph, since I am showing relationship between two categorial variables (Loan Status and Credit Grading), a grouped bar chart seems to be a good choice. 

For the second graph, since I am showing relationship between a continuous and categorical variables(Debt-to-income ratio and Loan Status), a boxplot is good in order to compate the medians and the trends per catogory (Loan Status).
